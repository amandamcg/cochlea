# Cochlea
## A configurable spectrum-band and beat-detection visualizer


**The cochlea _/ˈkɒk.lɪə/_** is the auditory portion of the inner ear. ![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Cochlea.svg/490px-Cochlea.svg.png)

The [cochlea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea) is a portion of the inner ear that looks like a snail shell (cochlea is Greek for snail.) The cochlea is filled with a watery liquid, the perilymph, which moves in response to the vibrations coming from the middle ear via the oval window. 

Thousands of hair cells sense the motion via their stereocilia, and convert that motion to electrical signals that are communicated via neurotransmitters to many thousands of nerve cells. These transform the signals into electrochemical impulses which travel along the auditory nerve to structures in the brainstem for further processing.

Because of [how the ear works](http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar11/articles/how-the-ear-works.htm), the average person's ears can detect sounds in frequency bands from 20Hz - 20kHz+, but our the frequency response in the inner ear is tuned for three octaves: 500Hz - 4kHz. Not coincidentally, most instruments operate mostly in this range. Frequency response drops drastically below 500 Hz, and above 4kHz it decreases slowly but steadily. This means while bass is "shaped" by the lowest frequencies, most of the "character" of beats is determined between 500Hz and 4kHz.
